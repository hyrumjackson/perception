# Perception ‚Äì IS 542 Final Project

Perception is a TypeScript-based single-page web app built with React. It is designed to simulate a self-ranking group game where users assess their personal traits within a peer group. The goal of this project was to demonstrate full mastery of React with TypeScript, API integration, state management, and strong UI/UX principles.

## üì¶ Project Overview

This application is a single-page game experience where one player hosts a game and others join using a room code. Each player ranks themselves based on humorous or insightful prompts. Points are awarded if a player uniquely selects a number. The app runs entirely on the client side with simulated multiplayer for demonstration.

---

## üõ† Technologies Used

- **React** (Functional Components, React Router)
- **TypeScript** with strict type checking
- **Context API** for global state management
- **Hooks**: useState, useEffect, useContext, useMemo
- **API Integration**: API Ninjas (Quotes API)
- **Custom Utility Functions** for prompt generation
- **Global CSS** for styling

---

## üîÑ Application Features

### ‚úÖ Functional Requirements:
- React + TypeScript application using modern development patterns
- Routing via `react-router-dom`
- Global state for players, game, and current prompts
- Quote API fetch on the home screen
- Prompt-based game with ranking and scoring logic

### ‚úÖ Additional Features:
- Animated player reveal in lobby and results
- Game settings (rounds, prompt type: auto or custom)
- Responsive and centered layout
- Custom prompts fallback ("Give your prompt to the group")
- Basic error prevention (disabled navigation without selection, etc.)

---

## üåê API Used

**API Ninjas - Quotes API**
- Used to display a quote on the title screen
- Random quote fetched from `https://api.api-ninjas.com/v1/quotes`
- Error handled with fallback message

Environment variable:
```env
REACT_APP_API_NINJAS_KEY=your-api-key-here
```
